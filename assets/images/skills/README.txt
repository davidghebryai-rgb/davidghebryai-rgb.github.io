Place the CAD images you attached into this folder with the following filenames:

- cad-att1-large.jpg   (full-size image 1)
- cad-att1-thumb.jpg   (thumbnail version for the gallery; ~200-400px wide recommended)
- cad-att2-large.jpg
- cad-att2-thumb.jpg
- cad-att3-large.jpg
- cad-att3-thumb.jpg

Recommended workflow:
1. Copy the original image into this folder and name it `cad-att1-large.jpg` (and similarly for 2 and 3).
2. Create a thumbnail version (smaller resolution, e.g. 400px width) and save as `cad-att1-thumb.jpg`.
3. Refresh `index.html` in your browser to see the updated Skill Gallery.

If you want, I can generate thumbnails and add the images for you — upload the full-resolution images into the workspace or tell me where they are and I'll process them.
